  └─ sub_9876543210_xyz789/
      └─ ...
```

### Student Data from Firebase

```
students/
  ├─ {uid}/
  │   ├─ uid: "uid-456"
  │   ├─ name: "John Doe"
  │   ├─ email: "john@example.com"
  │   ├─ photoURL: "https://..."
  │   ├─ institution: "University Name"
  │   └─ status: "approved"
```

### Exam Data from Backend

Exam details fetched from FastAPI backend:
- `GET /api/exams/published` - List of published exams
- Contains: title, duration, question count

## Technical Implementation

### Components

**SubmissionManagement.jsx**
- Main dashboard component
- Loads all data (submissions, students, exams)
- Handles filtering, sorting, searching
- Manages statistics calculation
- Export to CSV functionality

**FirebaseSubmissionReview.jsx**
- Modal for detailed submission view
- Score editing with Firebase update
- Displays student answers
- Shows timing information

### Services Used

**FirebaseAuthService.js**
```javascript
// Get all submissions
await FirebaseAuthService.getAllSubmissions();

// Get single submission
await FirebaseAuthService.getSubmission(submissionId);

// Update score
await FirebaseAuthService.updateSubmissionScore(submissionId, newScore);

// Get all students
await FirebaseAuthService.getAllStudents();

// Get student profile
await FirebaseAuthService.getStudentProfile(uid);
```

**BackendService.js**
```javascript
// Get published exams
await BackendService.getPublishedExams();

// Get full exam details
await BackendService.getFullExam(examId);
```

### Routes

Added new route in **AdminRouter.jsx**:
```javascript
<Route 
  path="/submissions" 
  element={<AdminLayout><SubmissionManagement /></AdminLayout>} 
/>
```

### Sidebar Navigation

Updated **Sidebar.jsx** with new menu item:
```javascript
{ 
  name: 'Submissions', 
  path: '/admin/submissions', 
  icon: <ClipboardList className="w-5 h-5" /> 
}
```

## Statistics Calculations

### Total Submissions
```javascript
const total = submissions.length;
```

### Passed Count
```javascript
const passed = submissions.filter(sub => {
  const percentage = (sub.score / sub.totalQuestions) * 100;
  return percentage >= 60;
}).length;
```

### Failed Count
```javascript
const failed = total - passed;
```

### Average Score
```javascript
const avgScore = submissions.length > 0
  ? submissions.reduce((sum, sub) => 
      sum + (sub.score / sub.totalQuestions) * 100, 0
    ) / submissions.length
  : 0;
```

### Manually Graded Count
```javascript
const manuallyGraded = submissions.filter(sub => 
  sub.manuallyGraded === true
).length;
```

## Filtering Logic

### Search Filter
```javascript
filtered = filtered.filter(sub => {
  const student = students[sub.studentUid];
  const exam = exams[sub.examId];
  const query = searchQuery.toLowerCase();
  
  return (
    student?.name?.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
    student?.email?.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
    exam?.title?.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
    sub.id?.toLowerCase().includes(query)
  );
});
```

### Status Filter
```javascript
if (statusFilter === 'passed') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(sub => {
    const percentage = (sub.score / sub.totalQuestions) * 100;
    return percentage >= 60;
  });
} else if (statusFilter === 'failed') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(sub => {
    const percentage = (sub.score / sub.totalQuestions) * 100;
    return percentage < 60;
  });
} else if (statusFilter === 'manual') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(sub => sub.manuallyGraded === true);
}
```

### Exam Filter
```javascript
if (examFilter !== 'all') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(sub => sub.examId === examFilter);
}
```

## CSV Export Format

## Performance Considerations

### Loading Strategy
1. Load all submissions (Firebase)
2. Load all students (Firebase)
3. Load published exams (Backend)
4. Build lookup maps for O(1) access
5. Display data

### Optimization
- Students and exams stored in maps for fast lookup
- Filtering done client-side (fast for <1000 submissions)
- Sorting uses native JavaScript methods
- CSV export uses Blob API (memory efficient)

## Permissions

**Admin Only:**
- Only admins (email whitelist) can access
- Protected by ProtectedRoute component
- Requires Firebase authentication
- Admin emails:
  - `aminulislam004474@gmail.com`
  - `shahsultanweb@gmail.com`

## Error Handling

**Loading Failures:**
- Shows loading spinner
- Catches errors in console
- Falls back to empty arrays
- Displays "No submissions" message

**Update Failures:**
- Shows alert on save error
- Keeps edit mode open
- Logs error to console
- User can retry

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions

1. **Bulk Actions:**
   - Select multiple submissions
   - Bulk grade with same score
   - Bulk export selected

2. **Advanced Analytics:**
   - Score distribution chart
   - Performance trends over time
   - Student comparison graphs

3. **Filters:**
   - Date range picker
   - Institution filter
   - Score range slider

4. **Notifications:**
   - Email student on manual grade update
   - Admin notifications for new submissions

5. **Comments:**
   - Add feedback comments to submissions
   - Student can view teacher notes

6. **Grading Rubric:**
   - Custom grading criteria
   - Question-by-question feedback
   - Partial credit support

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No submissions showing

**Check:**
1. Are there any submissions in Firebase?
   - Go to Firebase Console → Realtime Database
   - Check `submissions/` node
2. Is data loading?
   - Open browser console
   - Look for errors
3. Are filters applied?
   - Reset all filters to "All"
   - Clear search box

### Issue: Student names showing as "Unknown"

**Solution:**
- Student profile missing in Firebase
- Check `students/{uid}` exists
- Verify `name` field populated

### Issue: Exam titles showing as "Unknown Exam"

**Solution:**
- Exam not published or deleted
- Check backend has exam with that ID
- Verify `/api/exams/published` returns exam

### Issue: Can't save score

**Check:**
1. Firebase rules allow updates
2. Admin is authenticated
3. Submission ID is correct
4. Network connection active

### Issue: Export not working

**Solution:**
- Check browser allows downloads
- Disable popup blocker
- Try different browser
- Check console for errors
