## üêõ Debugging Tips

If stuck:

1. **API not working?**
   - Check backend logs: `tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log`
   - Verify MongoDB: `mongo` then `use ielts_platform` then `db.tracks.find()`

2. **Frontend not rendering?**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify imports are correct
   - Check component props

3. **Autosave not working?**
   - Check network tab for 429 (too many requests)
   - Verify debounce is working (should fire every 3s max)
   - Check localStorage as backup

4. **Questions not rendering?**
   - Verify QuestionWrapper import
   - Check question type matches component map
   - Console.log the question object

5. **Audio not playing?**
   - Check CORS headers
   - Verify audio URL is accessible
   - Check file format
