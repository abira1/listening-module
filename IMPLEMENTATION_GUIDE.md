3. **Authentication** - Simple demo auth (need proper Firebase Auth)
4. **Test Interface** - Questions not yet displayed (need question renderers)
5. **Submission System** - Not yet saving/grading answers

## 📝 How to Test

### **Test the Public Site:**
```bash
# Visit homepage
open http://localhost:3000

# You should see published tests listed
# Click on any test to start (if audio is uploaded)
```

### **Test the Admin Panel:**
```bash
# Login to admin
open http://localhost:3000/admin/login

# Use credentials:
# Email: admin@example.com
# Password: password

# Navigate through:
# - Dashboard (see statistics)
# - Test Management (create, edit, delete tests)
# - Audio Upload (upload test audio)
# - Question Manager (add questions to sections)
```

### **Test Firebase Integration:**
```bash
# Open Firebase Console:
# https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ssiltes-mock/database

# You should see data being created in real-time as you:
# - Create tests
# - Upload audio
# - Add questions
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Firebase Security Rules** - Current rules allow all read/write. Set proper security rules in production:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "exams": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": "auth != null"
    },
    "questions": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": "auth != null"
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Audio Files** - For production, integrate Firebase Storage:
```javascript
import { getStorage, ref, uploadBytes, getDownloadURL } from 'firebase/storage';
```

3. **Performance** - Consider implementing:
   - Pagination for large test lists
   - Lazy loading for questions
   - Caching with React Query
