      "index": 1,
      "title": "Passage 1: Technology in Education",
      "passage_text": "A. Technology has transformed education over the past two decades. Interactive whiteboards, tablets, and learning management systems have become commonplace in classrooms worldwide. Teachers now have access to vast digital resources, enabling them to create engaging, multimedia-rich lessons that cater to diverse learning styles. Students benefit from immediate feedback, personalized learning paths, and the ability to learn at their own pace.\n\nB. Online learning platforms have democratized education, making quality courses accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offered by prestigious universities allow millions of learners globally to access world-class education for free or at minimal cost. This has been particularly beneficial for those in remote areas or developing countries where educational resources are limited.\n\nC. However, the digital divide remains a significant challenge. Not all students have equal access to technology or reliable internet connections. This inequality was starkly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic when schools shifted to remote learning. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds often lacked the devices or connectivity needed to participate fully in online education, exacerbating existing educational disparities.\n\nD. Despite these challenges, technology continues to evolve and offer new possibilities for education. Artificial intelligence is beginning to play a role in personalized learning, adaptive testing, and automated grading. Virtual reality offers immersive learning experiences, allowing students to explore historical sites, conduct virtual science experiments, or practice skills in safe, simulated environments. These innovations promise to make education more engaging, effective, and accessible than ever before.",

      "title": "Passage 2: Climate Change Solutions",
      "passage_text": "A. Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, melting ice caps, and rising sea levels threaten ecosystems, economies, and human societies worldwide. Scientists agree that immediate action is necessary to mitigate the worst effects of climate change and adapt to changes already underway.\n\nB. Renewable energy technologies offer promising solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Solar panels have become increasingly efficient and affordable, with costs falling by over 80% in the past decade. Wind turbines, both onshore and offshore, now provide significant portions of electricity in many countries. Hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and tidal power contribute to the clean energy mix. The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is essential for limiting global temperature rise.\n\nC. Beyond energy production, carbon capture and storage technologies are being developed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere or prevent its release from industrial processes. Some innovative approaches include direct air capture, which uses chemical processes to extract carbon dioxide directly from ambient air, and carbon sequestration in forests, soil, and ocean ecosystems. While these technologies show promise, they are still in early stages of development and deployment.\n\nD. Individual actions also play a crucial role in addressing climate change. Reducing meat consumption, minimizing air travel, using public transportation, and adopting energy-efficient practices at home can collectively make a significant impact. Consumer choices influence corporate behavior, encouraging companies to adopt more sustainable practices. Education and awareness are key to motivating widespread behavioral change necessary to combat climate change effectively.",

      "index": 3,
      "title": "Passage 3: Artificial Intelligence Ethics",
      "passage_text": "A. Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced rapidly, raising important ethical questions that society must address. As AI systems become more sophisticated and integrated into critical decision-making processes, concerns about bias, privacy, accountability, and the potential for misuse have intensified. Establishing ethical frameworks for AI development and deployment is essential to ensure these powerful technologies benefit humanity while minimizing potential harms.\n\nB. One major ethical concern involves algorithmic bias. AI systems learn from historical data, which may reflect existing societal biases related to race, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. When biased data trains AI models, these systems can perpetuate or even amplify discrimination. For example, facial recognition systems have shown lower accuracy rates for people with darker skin tones, and hiring algorithms have been found to favor male candidates. Addressing bias requires diverse development teams, careful data curation, and ongoing monitoring of AI system outcomes.\n\nC. Privacy is another critical issue in the age of AI. Machine learning systems often require vast amounts of personal data to function effectively. This data collection raises concerns about surveillance, consent, and data security. The potential for AI to enable mass surveillance, track individuals' movements and behaviors, or predict personal information from seemingly innocuous data points creates significant privacy risks. Regulations like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) attempt to address these concerns, but challenges remain.\n\nD. Accountability presents a complex challenge as AI systems become more autonomous. When an AI system makes a harmful decision, determining responsibility becomes difficult. Should the developers, the organizations deploying the system, or the AI itself be held accountable? This question becomes particularly pressing in contexts like autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, or criminal justice, where AI decisions can have life-altering consequences. Clear legal frameworks and ethical guidelines are needed to establish accountability mechanisms.\n\nE. Despite these challenges, many researchers and organizations are working to develop ethical AI. Principles such as transparency, fairness, and human oversight are being incorporated into AI development processes. Some advocate for 'explainable AI' that can provide understandable reasons for its decisions. Others emphasize the importance of maintaining human control over critical decisions, with AI serving as a tool to augment rather than replace human judgment. The goal is to harness AI's potential while ensuring it aligns with human values and serves the common good.",
