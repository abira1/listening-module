      "title": "Passage 1: The History of Music and Brain Performance",
      "instructions": "Read the passage and answer questions 1-14.",
      "passage_text": "Music has been an integral part of human culture for thousands of years. Paragraph A discusses the earliest archaeological evidence of musical instruments, dating back to 40,000 years ago. Flutes made from bird bones and mammoth ivory were discovered in caves in southern Germany. These ancient instruments demonstrate that music was important to our ancestors.\n\nParagraph B explores how music affects the human brain. Recent neurological studies have shown that listening to music activates multiple regions of the brain simultaneously. The auditory cortex processes sound, while the motor cortex responds to rhythm. The limbic system, responsible for emotions, is also heavily involved. This widespread neural activation suggests music is deeply embedded in our cognitive architecture.\n\nParagraph C examines the effects of music on learning and memory. Several studies have investigated whether music can enhance academic performance. Researchers at Stanford University found that students who listened to classical music before exams showed improved concentration. However, the effect was temporary and varied between individuals. Some students performed better, while others showed no significant change.\n\nParagraph D discusses the controversial 'Mozart Effect.' In 1993, a study claimed that listening to Mozart's music could temporarily boost IQ scores. This finding captured public imagination and led to widespread recommendations. Parents began playing Mozart to infants, hoping to enhance their intelligence. However, subsequent research has failed to replicate these dramatic results. Most scientists now believe the original study's findings were exaggerated.\n\nParagraph E looks at music education in schools. Learning to play a musical instrument requires discipline, practice, and coordination. Studies have shown that children who receive music education often demonstrate improved mathematical abilities and language skills. The transfer of skills from music to other domains is well-documented. However, researchers debate whether music training causes these improvements or whether naturally gifted children simply excel in multiple areas.",

      "instructions": "Read the passage and answer questions 15-27.",
      "passage_text": "The transition to renewable energy is one of the most critical challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Solar power has emerged as a leading solution, with photovoltaic cells converting sunlight directly into electricity. The efficiency of solar panels has improved dramatically over the past decade, from around 15% to over 22% in commercial applications. This technological advancement has made solar energy increasingly competitive with fossil fuels.\n\nWind energy represents another major renewable source. Modern wind turbines can generate up to 12 megawatts of electricity, enough to power thousands of homes. Offshore wind farms, located in coastal waters, benefit from stronger and more consistent winds than their onshore counterparts. Denmark has become a world leader in wind energy, with wind turbines supplying over 40% of the country's electricity needs.\n\nHydroelectric power has been used for over a century and remains the largest source of renewable electricity globally. Dams harness the energy of flowing water to generate electricity. While highly efficient, large hydroelectric projects can have significant environmental impacts, including habitat destruction and changes to river ecosystems. Small-scale hydroelectric installations offer a more environmentally friendly alternative.\n\nEnergy storage remains a crucial challenge for renewable systems. Solar and wind energy are intermittent, producing power only when the sun shines or wind blows. Advanced battery technologies, particularly lithium-ion batteries, are improving rapidly. Grid-scale storage facilities can store excess renewable energy for use during periods of low production. The future energy system will likely combine multiple renewable sources with sophisticated storage and distribution networks.",

      "passage_text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming every aspect of modern life, from healthcare to transportation. Machine learning algorithms can now diagnose diseases with accuracy rivaling human doctors. In radiology, AI systems analyze medical images to detect tumors, fractures, and other abnormalities. These systems process thousands of images quickly, helping doctors make faster, more accurate diagnoses.\n\nAutonomous vehicles represent one of the most visible AI applications. Self-driving cars use sensors, cameras, and sophisticated algorithms to navigate roads safely. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Uber have invested billions in developing this technology. Proponents argue autonomous vehicles will reduce traffic accidents caused by human error. However, critics raise concerns about safety, liability, and job displacement for professional drivers.\n\nIn education, AI-powered tutoring systems provide personalized instruction tailored to individual students' needs. These systems track student progress, identify weaknesses, and adjust teaching methods accordingly. Early results suggest AI tutoring can improve student outcomes, particularly in mathematics and science.\n\nThe workplace is also being transformed by AI. Automation is replacing routine tasks in manufacturing, data entry, and customer service. Some economists predict that up to 40% of current jobs could be automated within two decades. This prospect raises important questions about the future of work and the need for worker retraining programs.",
