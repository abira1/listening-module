Born Maria Sklodowska in Poland in 1867, she is famous for her work on radioactivity, and was twice a winner of the Nobel Prize. With her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel, she was awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics, and was then sole winner of the 1911 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.</p><p>From childhood, Marie was remarkable for her prodigious memory, and at the age of 16 won a gold medal on completion of her secondary education. Because her father lost his savings through bad investment, she then had to take work as a teacher. From her earnings she was able to finance her sister Bronia&#8217;s medical studies in Paris, on the understanding that Bronia would, in turn, later help her to get an education.</p><p>In 1891 this promise was fulfilled and Marie went to Paris and began to study at the Sorbonne (the University of Paris). She often worked far into the night and lived on little more than bread and butter and tea. She came first in the examination in the physical sciences in 1893, and in 1894 was placed second in the examination in mathematical sciences. It was not until the spring of that year that she was introduced to Pierre Curie.<br/><br/><span connect:author-class="fs14pt"><strong/></span></p></div><div connect:author-class="right"><div connect:author-class="container generic"><p><strong>Questions 1</strong> &#8211; <strong>3<br/></strong>Choose <strong><strong>TRUE </strong></strong>if the statement agrees with the information given in the text, choose <strong><strong>FALSE </strong></strong>if the statement contradicts the information, or choose <strong><strong>NOT GIVEN</strong></strong> if there is no information on this.</p><div connect:author-class="container accordionChoice" connect:author-id="choice-accordion-interaction-IDAXXAG"><div xmlns:sem="http://connect.ucles.org.uk/ns/QTIExtendedSemantics" connect:class="choiceInteraction blockInteraction interaction" connect:hasPrompt="true" connect:maxChoices="1" connect:responseIdentifier="IELTARCB-SAMPLEA-0-1"><span class="questionNumber">1</span><p connect:class="prompt">Marie Curie&#8217;s husband was a joint winner of both Marie&#8217;s Nobel Prizes.</p><ul connect:shuffle="false"><li connect:class="simpleChoice choice"><label><input name="IELTARCB-SAMPLEA-0-1" type="radio" value="A"/><p>TRUE</p></label></li><li connect:class="simpleChoice choice"><label><input name="IELTARCB-SAMPLEA-0-1" type="radio" value="B"/><p>FALSE</p></label></li><li connect:class="simpleChoice choice"><label><input name="IELTARCB-SAMPLEA-0-1" type="radio" value="C"/><p>NOT GIVEN</p></label></li></ul></div><div xmlns:sem="http://connect.ucles.org.uk/ns/QTIExtendedSemantics" connect:class="choiceInteraction blockInteraction interaction" connect:hasPrompt="true" connect:maxChoices="1" connect:responseIdentifier="IELTARCB-SAMPLEA-0-2"><span class="questionNumber">2</span><p connect:class="prompt">Marie became interested in science when she was a child.</p><ul connect:shuffle="false"><li connect:class="simpleChoice choice"><label><input name="IELTARCB-SAMPLEA-0-2" type="radio" value="A"/><p>TRUE</p></label></li><li connect:class="simpleChoice choice"><label><input name="IELTARCB-SAMPLEA-0-2" type="radio" value="B"/><p>FALSE</p></label></li><li connect:class="simpleChoice choice"><label><input name="IELTARCB-SAMPLEA-0-2" type="radio" value="C"/><p>NOT GIVEN</p></label></li></ul></div><div xmlns:sem="http://connect.ucles.org.uk/ns/QTIExtendedSemantics" connect:class="choiceInteraction blockInteraction interaction" connect:hasPrompt="true" connect:maxChoices="1" connect:responseIdentifier="IELTARCB-SAMPLEA-0-3"><span class="questionNumber">3</span><p connect:class="prompt">Marie was able to attend the Sorbonne because of her sister&#8217;s financial contribution.</p><ul connect:shuffle="false"><li connect:class="simpleChoice choice"><label><input name="IELTARCB-SAMPLEA-0-3" type="radio" value="A"/><p>TRUE</p></label></li><li connect:class="simpleChoice choice"><label><input name="IELTARCB-SAMPLEA-0-3" type="radio" value="B"/><p>FALSE</p></label></li><li connect:class="simpleChoice choice"><label><input name="IELTARCB-SAMPLEA-0-3" type="radio" value="C"/><p>NOT GIVEN</p></label></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
