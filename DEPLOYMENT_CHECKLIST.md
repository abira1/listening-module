## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: OAuth Popup Blocked
**Solution:** Enable popups for Firebase domain in browser settings

### Issue: "Auth domain not authorized"
**Solution:** 
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Authentication â†’ Settings â†’ Authorized domains
2. Add your deployment domain: `ielts-listening-module.web.app`

### Issue: Database permission denied
**Solution:**
1. Check Firebase Console â†’ Realtime Database â†’ Rules
2. Verify rules are deployed correctly
3. Test rules in Rules Playground

### Issue: Admin email not recognized
**Solution:**
1. Check `FirebaseAuthService.js` - verify email in ADMIN_EMAILS array
2. Ensure exact match (case-sensitive)
3. Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue: Submissions not saving
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Firebase Auth token is valid
3. Check database rules allow write access
4. Verify `FirebaseAuthService.saveSubmission()` is being called

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution:**
```bash
cd /app/frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
yarn install
yarn build
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Firebase Console Checks
- [ ] Authentication â†’ Users (verify users being created)
- [ ] Realtime Database â†’ Data (verify data structure)
- [ ] Hosting â†’ Releases (verify deployment history)

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Monitor database usage
- [ ] Check authentication logs
- [ ] Review error logs in console
- [ ] Update Firebase SDK versions periodically
